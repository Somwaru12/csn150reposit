# Wifi Penetration Tool ESP32
## Purpose
This is for my final project it follows Risineks documentation and allows the esp32 to become a wifi penetration tool.
### Equipment
. ESP32
. Micro USB
#### Documentation
. (https://github.com/risinek/esp32-wifi-penetration-tool)
. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjekZXoy91Y)
##### Steps
. I downloaded Risinek's project zip file and unzipped it 
. install Python 
. pip install esptool on python 
. open cmd and run this while the esp32 is connected make sure to change what's in between -p and -b to what com port is being used 
. esptool.py -p /dev/ttyS5 -b 115200 --after hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x8000 build/partition_table/partition-table.bin 0x1000 build/bootloader/bootloader.bin 0x10000 build/esp32-wifi-penetration-tool.bin
. make sure the directory is correct 
. it is now installed 
. open up network connections and connect to ManagementAP the password is mgmtadmin 
. The ESP32 now acts as a router for testing you would need to go to 192.168.4.1 
. pick which wifi connection you want to test and what attack you want to carry out and start during its attack time you are unable to connect to the esp
###### Problems 
One of the problems I had was the pip install of the esp32 was not working i just had to change an option in uninstall or change program go to python and modify and check off add python to environment variables. 
the second issue I had was the code I had to remove the .py from esptool for it to start installing to the ESP
